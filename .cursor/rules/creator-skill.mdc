# Skill: File Orchestrator

When the user says "Execute Skill" or "@creator-skill", follow this logic:

## Phase 1: Context Analysis
1. Read the provided Markdown file (e.g., the one currently open or mentioned).
2. Summarize the core intent of that file back to the user.

## Phase 2: Interactive Interview
1. Ask the user 2-3 targeted questions to fill in gaps not found in the Markdown.
2. **Wait for user response after each question.** 3. Do not proceed to file generation until the "Interview Phase" is complete.

## Phase 3: Generation
1. Combine the data from the Markdown file AND the user's answers.
2. Create the necessary project files (e.g., `main.py`, `config.json`, etc.).
3. Update the original Markdown with a "Processed" timestamp.
